# milestone 1
# I chose the MESSENGER project because it is an instant messaging program.
# The first step is to log in and register. When registering with any service or website, you create an account. 
# In this case, the user is asked to come up with a username and password. I also have 5 controller models of 5 
# and use validation, And the migration is done.
# A password is a secret set of characters that protects your account. Login is the word that will be used to enter the 
# site. I have not finished yet, I will continue to work
